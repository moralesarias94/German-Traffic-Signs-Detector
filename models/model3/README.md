# LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network
This model is using a LeNet-5 Architecture with a small modification to the input layer. The input layer has the following shape 32x32x3, so the first layer has to change from (5x5x1)x(6 filters) to 5x5x3x6. I randomly initialized the parameters of all layers and defined the activation functions as tanhs.  I also had to modify the last layer because this classification task requires 43 outputs. And finally I used MSE as the cost function. LeNet-5 originally used Stochastic Gradient Descent with variable learning rates (decaying learning rates), in this model I used an AdamOptimizer with a learning rate that decays over time but not in the same proportions as the paper suggests. We could improve the model replacing tanh non-linearity with relu because tanh gets saturated easily. There is a problem when testing with internet images because traffic signs often vary in color but remains the same in meaning. The only way to solve this is to include in the training images with different sign colors or using a channel with the average of the three channels RGB.
